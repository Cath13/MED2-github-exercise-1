# MED2 GitHub Exercises

Before the exercise, please make sure that you have installed Unity version 2020.3.28f1, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), and a source-code editor (such as Visual Studio Code). Also make sure that you have created a GitHub account on www.github.com.

### 1. Fork and clone repository
- Go together in groups of two.
- **One** person from the group should:
  - Fork this GitHub repository by pressing <img src="https://github.com/malteerasmussen/MED2-github-exercise/blob/main/Fork%20button.png" height="25"> in the top right corner. This will create a forked (a copy) repository. 
  The forked repository will be called "[your github username]/MED2-github-exercise".
  - Add the other group member to the forked repository (the one you just created) by going to Settings > Collaborators > Add people.
- The **other** group member then receives an invitation by email and should:
  - Accept the invitation to join the repository.
- **Both** group members should then:
  - Clone the repository by pressing <img src="https://github.com/malteerasmussen/MED2-github-exercise/blob/main/Code%20button.png" height="25"> and then "Open with GitHub Desktop". If you get a pop-up asking "How are you planning to use this fork?" you should choose "For my own purposes."

### 2. Pull and push
- Open the Unity project "GitHub Unity Exercise" located in your local repository.
- Locate and open the script "ExerciseCode.cs".
- on **one** computer, edit the code to add the function call "<em>PassByValue(myVariable);</em>" on line 14, as indicated in the code. Save and press play in Unity to observe the result in the console.
- Go back to GitHub Desktop. Here you can now see the changes you have made. Write a summary of the change and press "Commit to main". Upload your local changes by pressing the "Push" button at the top.
- Now, on the **other** computer, go to GitHub Desktop and press "Fetch" at the top. Then press "Pull". This fetches and downloads the content on the remote repository and updates your local repository to match the content. Go to the Unity project and open the "ExerciseCode.cs" script to see that you now have the updated code.

### 3. Merge conflicts
